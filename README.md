# base-demo

Reference Base-managed project and representative demo environment.

This repository is the public reference project for Base-managed repositories.
It demonstrates Base on a compact but credible project shape: small enough to
inspect in one sitting, but substantial enough to represent the tools and
runtime variety found in a medium-sized engineering organization.

The long-term direction is documented in
[Representative Environment Design](docs/representative-environment.md).
`base-demo` is intentionally positioned between a toy sample and
[`banyanlabs`](https://github.com/basefoundry/banyanlabs): it borrows the
shape of a realistic platform environment while keeping each service shallow so
Base orchestration remains the point.

## Quick Start

Clone `base` and `base-demo` as peer directories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basefoundry/base.git
git clone https://github.com/basefoundry/base-demo.git
```

From the `base-demo` repository root on a machine where Base is already set up:

```bash
basectl projects list
basectl setup base-demo
basectl activate base-demo
basectl check base-demo
basectl doctor base-demo
basectl repo check .
basectl workspace status --manifest workspace.yaml.example
basectl run base-demo --list
basectl run base-demo hello
basectl run base-demo services -- status
basectl run base-demo environments -- list
basectl test base-demo
basectl logs --limit 3
basectl history --project base-demo --limit 5
basectl build base-demo
basectl demo base-demo
basectl export-context base-demo --format markdown --print
```

The commands above exercise the complete Base project loop:

- `basectl projects list` proves the repository is discoverable from the
  workspace.
- `basectl setup base-demo` reconciles the project manifest, Brewfile, and
  project virtual environment.
- `basectl activate base-demo` starts a project shell with the activation
  source applied.
- `basectl check base-demo` and `basectl doctor base-demo` validate the local
  project environment from that activated shell.
- `basectl repo check .` validates the standard repository baseline files.
- `basectl workspace status --manifest workspace.yaml.example` shows a
  workspace-level view of the expected `base`, `base-demo`, and
  `base-bash-libs` peer repositories.
- `basectl run base-demo --list` shows the manifest-declared project commands.
- `basectl run base-demo hello` runs the `hello` command from the project root.
- `basectl run base-demo services -- status` shows the representative service
  catalog and current health state.
- `basectl run base-demo environments -- list` shows the modeled
  `dev`/`staging`/`prod` configuration set.
- `basectl test base-demo` runs the manifest-declared test command.
- `basectl logs --limit 3` and `basectl history --project base-demo --limit 5`
  show the local audit trail for recent Base activity.
- `basectl build base-demo` runs the default build target (`info`) declared in the manifest.
- `basectl demo base-demo` runs the project-owned walkthrough.
- `basectl export-context base-demo --format markdown --print` prints the
  repository AI context bundle for assistant handoff.

`basectl activate base-demo` spawns a new subshell, sources `.base/activate.sh`,
and updates the prompt to `[base-demo: <branch>] ~/path $`. Inside that shell,
`BASE_DEMO_ENV` is `baseline` (set by activate.sh). Run `exit` or press Ctrl-D
to return to the original shell. The environment changes disappear when the
subshell exits — no explicit deactivation is needed.

Expected command output includes:

```text
$ basectl run base-demo --list

## BASE_DEMO_ENV Health Check

Normal green path: run `basectl check base-demo` and
`basectl doctor base-demo` from the activated project shell, where
`BASE_DEMO_ENV=baseline` has been set by `.base/activate.sh`.

Pre-activation diagnostic: if `BASE_DEMO_ENV` is missing, `check` and `doctor`
can report that finding intentionally. That output teaches how
`health.required_env` works; it does not mean the repository is corrupt.
Activate the project shell, or export `BASE_DEMO_ENV=baseline`, before using
`check` and `doctor` as green-path validation commands.

CI sets BASE_DEMO_ENV=baseline at the workflow level so automated validation is
deterministic without needing an interactive activated shell.

## Repository Shape

- `base_manifest.yaml` declares the project name, activation source, command,
  test command, and Brewfile location using current Base contracts.
- `Brewfile` is the Homebrew-owned place for ordinary macOS tools. The
  Brewfile currently installs mise, uv, Gradle, and Maven so setup can
  demonstrate tool-version management, command runners, and representative
  Java build tools.
- `.base/activate.sh` demonstrates project activation state.
- `src/hello.sh`, `src/env.sh`, `src/manifest.sh`, and `src/build-info.sh` are
  tiny command and build targets for `basectl run` and `basectl build`.
- `lib/python/base_demo_cli` is a tiny Python command target that runs inside
  the Base-managed project environment.
- `bin/base-demo-python-info` is the Bash launcher that delegates the Python
  package to `base-wrapper`.
- `src/uv-info.py` is a tiny Python command routed through `runner: uv`.
- `services/go-api` is a tiny Go HTTP API with `/healthz`, `/hello`, and
  `/info` endpoints. It is also the representative Dockerized app service.
- `services/python-api` is a tiny standard-library Python HTTP API with the
  same health, hello, and info surface on port 8020.
- `services/java-gradle-api` and `services/java-maven-api` are tiny Java HTTP
  APIs that keep Gradle and Maven visible as representative build tools.
- `services/c-service` and `services/cpp-service` are tiny native compiled
  fixtures with Makefile-backed build and command health checks.
- `services/demo-console` is a small React/Vite operational console that reads
  the service catalog and shows the representative stack.
- `bin/base-demo-services` reads `services/catalog.json` and provides the
  `services` lifecycle command for the representative environment.
- `bin/base-demo-environments` lists, shows, and validates environment
  configuration.
- `services/catalog.json` is the initial catalog for representative services,
  infrastructure, and lifecycle checks.
- `infra/compose.yaml` defines local Postgres, MySQL, Redis, and the
  Dockerized Go API for the representative dev environment.
- `environments/dev.json`, `environments/staging.json`, and
  `environments/prod.json` model environment-specific configuration. Only
  `dev` is operational by default.
- `.mise.toml` declares tool versions (Python 3.13) managed by mise.
- `demo/demo.sh` is the interactive walkthrough.
- `tests/validate.sh` verifies that the repository baseline is intact.

## Manifest Contract Map

`base_manifest.yaml` is the project contract Base reads. In this repository,
each field maps to a visible Base workflow:

| Manifest field | Demonstrated by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | `basectl setup base-demo` | Declares the manifest contract version Base should parse. |
| `project.name` | `basectl projects list` | Gives Base the stable project name used by setup, check, doctor, run, test, activate, and demo. |
| `brewfile` | `basectl setup base-demo` | Delegates ordinary Homebrew dependencies to `brew bundle`; currently installs mise, uv, Gradle, and Maven. |
| `health.required_env` | `basectl check base-demo` | Declares env vars that must be set; green in an activated shell and intentionally reported missing as a pre-activation diagnostic. |
| `health.required_ports` | `basectl check base-demo` | Declares that the baseline `go-api` port 8010 should be free before services are started. |
| `mise` | `basectl setup base-demo` | Points to `.mise.toml` so Base installs declared tool versions (Python 3.13) via mise. |
| `python.requires_python` | `basectl check base-demo` | Lets Base verify Python 3.13 independently of the mise installer declaration. |
| `activate.source` | `basectl activate base-demo` | Sources project-owned shell state into the activated project shell. |
| `ide.vscode` | `basectl setup base-demo` | Declares VS Code Python extensions and auto-injects the project venv as `python.defaultInterpreterPath` when IDE setup is enabled. |
| `commands` | `basectl run base-demo --list` | Declares named project commands such as `hello`, `env`, `manifest`, `python-info`, `uv-info`, `services`, and `environments`. |
| `commands[*].runner` | `basectl run base-demo uv-info` | Routes only the `uv-info` command through `uv run --`, without making uv the project-wide Python manager. |
| `build.targets` | `basectl build base-demo` | Declares build targets; the `info` target runs `src/build-info.sh`. |
| `build.targets[*].working_dir` | `basectl build base-demo go-api` | Runs the Go build from `services/go-api` without the target command needing to change directories itself. |
| `test.command` | `basectl test base-demo` | Defines the project-owned validation command. |
| `demo.script` | `basectl demo base-demo` | Defines the project-owned interactive walkthrough. |
| `artifacts` | `basectl setup base-demo` | Requests the `bats-core` tool artifact; the project setup layer reports whether Homebrew already has it or would install it. |

The demo now includes a shallow but representative environment: multi-language
service fixtures, one Dockerized app service, a React/Vite UI, Compose-backed
local databases and cache, and a lightweight `dev`/`staging`/`prod`
configuration model. The services stay intentionally small and readable; deeper
product and platform complexity belongs in Banyan Labs.

The environment model is present now:

```bash
basectl run base-demo environments -- list
basectl run base-demo environments -- show dev
basectl run base-demo environments -- validate --all
```

`dev` is the runnable local environment. `staging` and `prod` are modeled
configuration examples that are validated structurally but not deployed.

The first representative-environment command is:

```bash
basectl run base-demo services -- status
basectl run base-demo services -- check
BASE_DEMO_SERVICES_DRY_RUN=1 basectl run base-demo services -- start
```

It reads `services/catalog.json` and reports the current catalog health. Local
Postgres, MySQL, Redis, and the Dockerized Go API are declared through
`infra/compose.yaml`; the Python API is managed as a local process by the same
`services` command, as are the Java Gradle, Java Maven, C, C++, and React/Vite
console services. They are representative dependencies and services, and they
are optional in `services check` until started.

Both Gradle and Maven are present intentionally. They are common enough in real
enterprise Java estates that a medium-shaped demo should exercise both build
tool contracts, even when the service behavior stays hello-world small.

For CI or scripted validation, run the walkthrough without prompts:

```bash
basectl demo base-demo -- --non-interactive
```

CI also runs the representative BATS suites, validates every environment JSON
file, checks the service catalog, and exercises service startup through
`BASE_DEMO_SERVICES_DRY_RUN=1`. Docker and language-toolchain-heavy runtime
checks remain optional locally so the baseline stays useful on a fresh machine.
